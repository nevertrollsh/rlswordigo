# The Vial System in RLswordigo

The Vial system in RLswordigo is a powerful feature designed to boost heart regeneration, helping players recover health more efficiently. Vials can be purchased at Limehedge Village for 900 soul shards and come in three levels, each offering a progressively stronger regeneration effect. When paired with the Vitality Ring, the regeneration provided by each vial is doubled.

## Vial Level 1: Regenerates 1 full heart

• With Vitality Ring: Regenerates 2 full hearts


## Vial Level 2: Regenerates 1.5 hearts

• With Vitality Ring: Regenerates 3 full hearts


## Vial Level 3: Regenerates 2 hearts

• With Vitality Ring: Regenerates 4 full hearts



By upgrading to higher vial levels and using the Vitality Ring, players can significantly improve their heart regeneration, making it easier to survive tougher battles.
