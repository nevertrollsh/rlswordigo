## Feather Ring

The Feather Ring is a remarkable bauble that grants the wearer a jump boost, allowing for higher jumps that can be advantageous in many areas of the game.

## Magic Ring

The Magic Ring is among the most coveted baubles in the game, known for being one of the hardest to obtain. When equipped, it provides the wearer with infinite mana, allowing for unlimited use of magic abilities without the typical constraints. This extraordinary ring can be acquired by conquering one of the game's most challenging trials, known as The Shadow's Lair. Only the most skilled players will prevail in this demanding quest, making the Magic Ring a symbol of achievement.

## Vitality Ring

The Vitality Ring enhances health regeneration, offering faster and more efficient recovery, which is especially beneficial when used in conjunction with Vial potions. Players can obtain the Vitality Ring by defeating the second boss without taking any damage. This accomplishment not only requires skill but also strategic gameplay, and players can also earn it by completing the achievement titled "Like a Ninja."

## Fiery Pendant

The Fiery Pendant is an essential bauble for those who venture into fiery environments. Obtained by defeating the third boss, this pendant provides significant protection against lava, allowing players to explore hazardous areas without the fear of taking damage. This makes the Fiery Pendant a crucial accessory for players looking to traverse dangerous landscapes safely.
